title: Provision &amp; Bind New Kafka Service
---

Stark & Wayne Kafka allows all Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; users to create and use 
Kafka within their applications. Applications can then use any Kafka library 
to publish/subscribe to the Kafka topic.

## <a id="provision"></a>Provision & Bind

Create a new Kafka topic using the `cf create-service` (or `cf cs` alias):

```
cf create-service sw-kafka topic myapp-kafka
```

You can share the Kafka topic with one or more applications within the same Cloud Foundry "space".

```
cf bind-service myapp myapp-kafka
```

Applications have access to the connection information when they are next pushed, restarted, or restaged.

```
cf restart myapp
```

## <a id="credentials"></a>Credentials

The Kafka connection credentials pass
 to your application via environment variables, specifically [`$VCAP_SERVICES`](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#VCAP-SERVICES).

Either use a JSON parser or find a language-specific community Cloud Foundry 
library to make navigating this environment variable easy.

See the [Language Examples](lang-examples.html) for samples of looking up/using the credentials.

The `credentials` section contains the following keys:

```json
{
 "hostname": "10.244.0.148:9092,10.244.0.149:9092,10.244.0.155:9092",
 "topicName": "17e7faad-7f61-4baf-869d-1b72137bba98",
 "uri": "kafka://10.244.0.148:9092,10.244.0.149:9092,10.244.0.155:9092/17e7faad-7f61-4baf-869d-1b72137bba98"
}
```
