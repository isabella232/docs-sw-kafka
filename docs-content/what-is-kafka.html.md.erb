Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform providing the following capabilities:

### Publish and Subscribe

Read and write streams of data like a messaging system.

### Process

Write scalable stream processing applications that react to events in real-time.

### Store

Store streams of data safely in a distributed, replicated, fault-tolerant cluster.
