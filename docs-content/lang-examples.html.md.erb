The community of Cloud Foundry & Kafka users have created some example applications that can bind to Stark & Wayne Kafka™  service credentials for an Apache Kafka topic.

| Language | Source Code |
| --- | --- |
| Java/Spring | [Consumer](https://github.com/dingotiles/dingo-kafka-sample-apps/tree/master/kafka-sample-consumer) [Provider](https://github.com/dingotiles/dingo-kafka-sample-apps/tree/master/kafka-sample-producer) [Connector](https://github.com/dingotiles/dingo-kafka-sample-apps/tree/master/kafka-connector) |

## Credentials

The connection details are provided via `$VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable. An example of the credentials section will be:

```json
{
 "hostname": "10.244.0.148:9092,10.244.0.149:9092,10.244.0.155:9092",
 "topicName": "17e7faad-7f61-4baf-869d-1b72137bba98",
 "uri": "kafka://10.244.0.148:9092,10.244.0.149:9092,10.244.0.155:9092/17e7faad-7f61-4baf-869d-1b72137bba98"
